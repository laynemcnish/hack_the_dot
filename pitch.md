# Hippo.haus

* Travel Market: $8T
    * Big, but *crowded*:
        * *Lots* of well-established players.
        * Fragmented, overlapping value-chain due to breadth of coverage:
            * Hotels vs. Hostels vs. Cruises...
            * Air-fare, vs. Cruises vs. Trains...
            * Don't even get me started on food/alcohol!
    * Adventure Travel Market: $89B
    * A relatively un-crowded segment!
* Improve margins in this space:
    * Skim high-value travelers into adventure travel space.
        * More demand for lucrative concierge services!
        * Simplified offerings == lowered costs!
    * Increase value-proposition for adventure travel:  Get to know Hippos!
    * Alleviate barriers to adoption with tangible benefits:
        * Q: "Am I going to really enjoy this?"
        * A: "Fuck yes.  You get to talk to HIPPOS!"
    * Create barriers to entry through:
        * Exclusive partnerships up and down the value chain.
        * Proprietary Hippo-ese translation capability!
        * ... and hippos that will go *literally* stomp on our competitors.
